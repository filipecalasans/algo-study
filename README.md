# algo-study

This repository contains implementation of common data-structures in C++. I have been developed this repository with the main goal of studying C++11/14, data structures, debugging, testing and deployment.

The containers implemented in this library use implicit-sharing. Containers have reference to the same internal data-structure after assignment operation. The library rely on std smart pointers: shared\_pointer and unique\_pointer to implement the containers.


# Containers

  * DataArray
  * Array
  * Vector
  * List
  * Linked List
  * Queue
  * Stack
  * Heap (min-heap or priority queue)
  * Map (red-black tree)
